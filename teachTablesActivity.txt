1. Complete teachTables.py

2. SSH into VM

(for the purpose of this tutorial, we are only using the filter table)
(also, you will need knowledge of typical port numbers for popular protocols)

3. Set an iptables input rule allowing any packets from your IP

4. Set an iptables output rule allowing any packets to your IP

5. Set all of the table's default policies to DROP

6. Try to wget/curl a webpage. what happens?

7. Set rules allowing http and https traffic and counters initialized to packet:0 and byte:0.

8. Try to wget/curl a webpage again. What happens this time?

9. Chances are that your request failed. Troubleshoot why.

10. Once you've got that fixed, try to wget/curl yet another webpage.

11. List all the rules and take note of the counters for your rules. Are they what you expected?

12. Now play around with adding, checking, replacing, and deleting a few rules. (Just make sure you don't delete rules allowing traffic to/from you)

13. Flush the rules. (Just think before you act. Hint: Policies)

14. Repeat steps 3,4, and 5.

15. Time to learn about connection state matching. with the -m (--match) flag, one of the matches is the --state <state>[,...] where the different states are NEW,ESTABLISHED, RELATED, INVALID, and UNTRACKED.

16. Test playing with connections of certain states.

17. You are now proficient in iptables! Go read iptables-extensions manpage if you want to become a master.
